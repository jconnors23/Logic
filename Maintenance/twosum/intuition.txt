we know that we need to find occurence of target minus current val in i, how do we find it without scanning the whole arr?


i.e. how do we find does diff exist in nums?


use a dictionary, append to the dictionary the current value in nums each time we do NOT find a diff in nums.

check if difference exists in dictionary during each iteration, once the target difference is found, return the value of the nums[i] and the according difference

this requires only one iteration through nums

in the dict, the keys are the values in nums, and the values are their actual indexes

diff = target - nums[i]
            if diff in lookup:
                return [lookup[diff], i]
            else:
                lookup[nums[i]] = i
