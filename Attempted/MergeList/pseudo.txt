start at head of list 2, 


find where first val goes within list 1, then move pointer to next val in list 2 

keep track of prev node seen in 1 - pick up where you left off - prev becomes val of inserted node 


for node in list 

if val of node at 2 is >= val 1 node, insert node into list

    next iteration, if val of node is >= val of prev seen, same operation, update previous
