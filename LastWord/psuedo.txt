- we want to start at the end of str 

- we want to trace back, while tracking with counter until we reach an empty char aka a space

- we return counter

we index the last char via str[-1] init count of 0 



index = -1
pos = str[index]
count = 0 
empty = " "
while pos != empty:

    count++ 
    index-- 

return count
