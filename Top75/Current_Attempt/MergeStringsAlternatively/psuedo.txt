can compare lenghts of the 2 strings 

can gather shorter length 

len = min (str 1, str 2)

can store str that is shorter 

shorter = str 1 

can iterate and alt append

store last appended via flag 

str1 last append = false

merged = ""

for i in range min:

if not str1 last append

append merged via str 1

str1 = true 

else append str 2 


return merged 


iter 2 

best to track lenght we have in both then add based on last flag
