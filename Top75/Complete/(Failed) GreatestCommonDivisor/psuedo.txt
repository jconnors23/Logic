partition of string that is repeated one or more times in the other


it cant be just one instance of the partition, 
must be at least two instances that are also connected and vice versa



check from whole word in str 2 

if w/in str 1, check for repeat right after, 

    if no repeat, go next

move pointer left, check len(str-1) 


if at end and 1 char is repeated, check for repeat in the other str 

return longest 


can slice after occurence and check pos right after for match
